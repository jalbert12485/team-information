## About 
 In this project, we will use a node js program that allows the user to add, remove or display team members on his/her programming team.  After adding members information including name, role, id, email and role specific information, the program will generate an .html and .js file meant to nicely display the information for the user.

## Usage 
 In order to use this program, you will need to access the app.js file using a node terminal.  You will then be prompted to add, remove, display team members or stop.  In order to add team members, you will be prompted for relevant information.  When you are done adding a member, your employee list will be saved to another file.  When running, you can also remove members from your list.  To do this, you will be required to enter the employee ID that you assigned that member.  Otherwise, if you would like to remove all employees and start over, you can type 'All' when prompted for an ID.  After adding or removing a team member, the program will begin again so that you can add or remove more members or display or stop.  Finally, you can display the information on a webpage.  When running app.js and choosing display, a script.js and index.html will be created.  If you open this index.html in a browser you will be able to view your list of team members.  In order to change the focused member, you need only click on the name of the employee you would like to see more detail of.
